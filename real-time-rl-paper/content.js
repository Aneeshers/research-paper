    abstract:
      "Real-time reinforcement learning is different from standard RL because the world keeps moving while the agent plans. We study variable-delay real-time RL, where a gate chooses how long to deliberate at each decision point on top of a frozen AlphaZero-style MCTS planner. The resulting policy spends more compute when the state is risky or constrained, outperforms fixed-budget and heuristic baselines across Pac-Man, real-time Tetris, Snake, Speed Hex, and Speed Go, and transfers to a two-GPU deployment without retraining.",

            "The paper studies what happens when an RL agent cannot assume that the environment waits for it. In ordinary RL, planning is free from the world’s point of view; in real-time RL, thinking longer changes the state you eventually act in.",
            "That turns planning itself into a control problem. Instead of using a fixed search budget everywhere, the agent learns when to react immediately and when to spend extra time on MCTS.",

AlphaZero-style MCTS buys better actions with more simulations, but the same increase also raises decision latency. In real-time settings, that delay matters because the state changes before the final action lands.",
